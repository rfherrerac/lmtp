\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{trt}{A vector of column names for treatment variables.}

\item{outcome}{The column name of the outcome variable.}

\item{nodes}{A list of length tau with the column names for new nodes to
be introduced at each time point. The list should be ordered following
the time ordering of the model.}

\item{baseline}{An optional vector of columns names for baseline covariates to be
included for adjustment at every timepoint. If \code{k = Inf}, should be \code{NULL}
and these variables should be added to the first index of \code{nodes}.}

\item{cens}{An optional vector of column names of censoring indicators the same
length as \code{A}.}

\item{k}{An integer specifying how many previous time points nodes should be
used for estimation at the given time point. Default is \code{Inf},
all time points.}

\item{shift}{A function that specifies how tratment variables should be shifted.}

\item{outcome_type}{Outcome variable type (i.e., continuous, binomial).}

\item{bounds}{An optional vector of the bounds for continuous outcomes. If NULL
the bounds will be taken as the minimum and maximum of the observed data.
Ignored if outcome type is binary.}

\item{learners_outcome}{An \code{sl3} learner stack for estimation of the outcome
regression.}

\item{learners_trt}{An \code{sl3} learner stack for estimation of the exposure
mechanism.}

\item{folds}{The number of folds to be used for cross-validation.}
